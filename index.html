        <h2>Highlighted Projects</h2>

        <p>Some of the academic or personal projects related to computer science
          that I have had the opportunity to contribute to.</p>

          <h3>SQL Interpreter</h3>
          <p>Thanks to Python and ANTLR4, a tool used for compilers development.
          I created an interpreter for the SQL language.
          </p>
          <p>In addition, to handle data from csv tables, I used the well-known Pandas library and for the 
            graphical interface, Streamlit.

        <h3>Implementation of a Data Structure</h3>
        <p>This project consisted of the implementation of a KD-Tree. These are data structures 
          used to organize points in a k-dimensional space, 
          particularly useful for facilitating efficient operations like search. To achieve this, 
          it recursively divides the space along the axes into smaller regions, creating a hierarchical binary tree structure.</p>
        <p>KD-trees, in low to moderate dimensions, are particularly efficient for nearest-neighbor searches. 
          During a search, the tree is traversed to find the point closest to a given query point. 
          This is done by recursively exploring the branches of the tree and prioritizing those that are 
          more likely to contain the nearest neighbor.

        <h3>Use of Artificial Intelligence Algorithms</h3>
        <p>The goal of this project was, through the application of artificial intelligence algorithms, 
          specifically Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing,
          to develop the optimal bike transport planning for the Bicing service between different urban stations.</p>
        <p>The objective is to collect bikes from stations with low demand forecasts 
          and transport them to those where they are needed most urgently, all while 
          minimizing the costs associated with transport between stations.

        <h3>Creation of a REST API for an Application</h3>
        <p>This project allowed me to learn the basics of backend development. 
          In it, I developed an API for a contact application where, through HTTP requests, users could save, query, 
          edit, and delete contacts. To do this, I created a REST API following the Model-View-Controller architecture, 
          making it easy to switch between data models.
